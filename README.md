All the functions of the heat transfer module are based on three modes of heat transfer: conduction, convection and radiation. Conductivity in any material can have isotropic or anisotropic thermal conductivity and may be constant or a function of temperature. Convection, the movement of fluids in heat transfer simulation, can be natural forced or free convection. Thermal radiation can be accounted for using surface-to-surface radiation or radiation in semi-transparent media.

There are many variations in the modes of heat transfer, and the different modes must be considered together—in some cases, all three simultaneously. All of these require different equations to be run simultaneously to ensure accurate models. The heat transfer module is developed to handle any type of heat transfer you are looking to model.

The dielectric properties of PVDF Al-Al2o3 ferroelectric polymer embedded core-shell nanoparticle have been simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics® software. A significant increase in the electrical conductivity of the composite is obtained at the penetration threshold K = 2800 compared to the electrical conductivity of the bare polymer K = 12. Both Maxwell Garnett and Symmetric Bruggeman models have permittivity of about 26.2, which is in good agreement with our experimental values in a similar composite at the same loading. The simulation results show a net polarization drop by a factor of 3 in the contact region, which is expected by using a cap shell to electrically insulate the metal cores.

The aspect of novelty and innovation in the upcoming research is the use of nanofluid consisting of water and nanocellulose as fluid. The purpose of using nanofluid consisting of water and nanocellulose for heat transfer in oil, gas and petrochemical industries is to investigate and compare different nanofluids with nanofluid consisting of water and nanocellulose in heat transfer.

In this research, the aqueous solution of nanocellulose with a weight concentration of 0.5% has been used as a non-Newtonian base fluid. Al2O3 nanoparticles in sizes of 25, 45 and 100 nanometers and with volume concentrations of 0.5% and 1.5% have been considered. Due to the possibility of accessing the required variables through previous articles, the power-law model has been used to estimate the rheological behavior of viscous non-Newtonian fluids. The figure shows the geometry of the flow and the scope of solving the problem, which is a pipe with a circular cross-section and a length of 120 cm and a diameter of 0.475 cm.

 
Figure 1- Resolution domain and flow geometry

Due to the axial symmetry of the geometry of the problem in this research, the analysis has been done in 2D space. For meshing the flow geometry and using the Comsol software space, different grids have been investigated. Also, due to the rate of change of fluid speed and temperature near the wall and the importance of the accuracy of calculations in these areas, the divisions are uneven in the radial direction and the network is finer near the wall.

In this research, considering the number of repetitions in each grid and also the speed of reaching the answer, the amount of reasonable difference between two consecutive Nusselt numbers is considered to be less than 1%. Therefore, according to the results, the grid with 1200 x 10 divisions, i.e. 1200 divisions along the longitudinal axis of the pipe and 10 divisions along the radial direction from the center of the pipe, is suitable for the present research and has been investigated.

Due to the high Reynolds number and turbulent flow, the speed of fluid flow in the pipe is high and the opportunity for heat exchange is low. Therefore, as can be seen in the research, in turbulent flow, the amount of heat flux is
The purpose of the flow is to develop a higher temperature than the amount of heat flux in low Reynolds and slow flow in
opnions have been asked. Heat and moisture transfer in porous media
There are new interfaces and features for modeling heat and moisture transfer in porous media filled with moist air and liquid water. The new interface for moisture transport in porous media provides a hygroscopic porous medium property by default and can be used to model moisture transport in porous media by vapor convection and diffusion, as well as liquid water convective transport and capillary flow. The new interface for convection in the liquid and gas phases due to total pressure changes is calculated by modeling liquid capillary flux, and by adding support for gravity forces. It can be combined with the wet air feature to model the effect of wet air flow over a porous medium.

At the heat transfer interface, the new wet porous domain property defines the effective material properties from solid, liquid, and moist air properties separately. The humid air subnode defines material properties by considering the humidity level and calculates the convection flux and diffusion enthalpy flux in humid air. The liquid water subnode defines the liquid water saturation and velocity field, which may be automatically set by the Heat and Moisture multiphysics pair, if present. Solid properties are managed by the porous matrix sub-node. These new capabilities can be used for drying and evaporative cooling applications.

New medium porous feature
A new feature for moving a porous medium is available to define different phases: solids, fluids, and immobile fluids. At the heat transfer interface in porous media, the porous property is used to manage the material structure with a dedicated sub-property for each phase: fluid, porous matrix, and optionally, immobilized fluids. This new workflow provides greater clarity and improves the user experience. It also facilitates multiphysics connections in porous media in a more natural way. Along with the interfaces of moisture transfer and porous media flow, heat transfer is improved
